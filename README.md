# Singly_LinkedList
 This C++ code defines a singly linked list. The Node class represents each node with data and a pointer to the next node. The Insertathead function adds a new node at the beginning of the list. The print function displays the list. In main, it initializes a list with 10, adds 12, 15, and 16 to the head, printing the list after each addition.
